                                    <p class="margin-bottom">A simple closed circuit television (CCTV) system comprising of cameras, a digital video recorder and a monitor can be a great deterrent to would be criminals within an area of surveillance. The images recorded give
                                        valuable information which can assist to:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Detect activities that call for a security response;</li>
                                        <li>Collect images of an incident for later review and use as evidence if needed; and</li>
                                        <li>Assist with incident assessment.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The heart of the system is the video recorder which allows various functions such as remote monitoring, viewing of multiple sites and streaming to mobile devices.</p>
                                    <p>CCTV can reduce the amount of patrolling required to cut down on labor costs. In addition, security officers are not immediately exposed to any of the dangers appearing on the CCTV monitors. Logically a decrease in
                                        asset losses can be achieved.</p>

                                        <p> class="margin-bottom">Electric fences are your first line of defense as a visual deterrent to crime. Should anyone decide to call your bluff, power energizers emit a non-lethal electrical current, either continuously
                                            or in pulses, as per your specification.<br> When integrated with our intruder alarm solutions, not only does your electric fence become your first line of defence, it also becomes your first point of detection
                                            of any intruders. Sensors help ensure that the electric fence is tamper-proof by transmitting a signal to our control room as soon as any perpetrator attempts to compromise the fence.<br> Being transparent,

                                        in an area. If a sensor is tripped, a signal is sent to your security system's control panel, which connects to your monitoring center, alerting you and the monitoring center to a potential threat in your dwelling.</p>

                                    <h2>automatic intruder alarm system </h2>
                                    <p class="margin-bottom">Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. Unfortunately, only few people care enough to know how these actually work. Once they know how burglar alarms work, they will know how to utilize them to their fullest
                                        potential as well as know which systems would suit them best.<br> They will also know how to maintain their own systems and prevent or lessen false alarms. Usually, people just install them and they don't know how
                                        to use them. This might cause more harm and losses than gains for people who are ignorant.<br> The operation of a burglar alarm is the same that of an electric circuit. In order to know about burglar alarms and
                                        how they work, one has to compare them to a simple electric circuit or appliance. For example, one has to turn on a switch to turn of the lights or any other appliance. This principle works in the same way with
                                        burglar alarms. The only difference is that the movements of an intruder will be detected by the switch. If an intruder breaks in a house through a door or window, his movements will be detected by a switch which
                                        will trigger the burglar alarm.</p>
